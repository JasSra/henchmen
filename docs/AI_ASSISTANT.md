## üîí Security Considerations

**API Key Protection:**
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate keys regularly

**Rate Limiting:**
- OpenAI enforces rate limits
- Consider caching responses
- Add request throttling for production

**Data Privacy:**
- Chat history stored in memory only
- No persistent storage of conversations
- Logs may contain deployment details

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### AI Not Available

**Error:** "AI assistant not available"

**Solutions:**
1. Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Ensure `AI_ENABLED=true`
4. Restart controller

### Voice Commands Not Working

**Error:** "Microphone access denied"

**Solutions:**
1. Grant microphone permissions in browser
2. Use HTTPS (required for microphone in some browsers)
3. Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Edge recommended)

### Slow Responses

**Causes:**
- Large chat history
- Complex queries
- OpenAI API latency

**Solutions:**
- Clear chat (refresh page)
- Use simpler queries
- Check OpenAI status

### Rate Limit Exceeded

**Error:** "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes
- Upgrade OpenAI plan
- Implement request throttling

## üìä Performance Tips

**For Fast Responses:**
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` model
- Keep queries concise
- Limit chat history to 10 messages

**For Better Accuracy:**
- Use `gpt-4o` model
- Provide more context
- Ask specific questions

**Cost Optimization:**
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` (cheapest)
- Cache common queries
- Limit insight refresh frequency

## üéØ Use Cases

### DevOps Engineer
- "Deploy latest version to staging"
- "Show me production deployment history"
- "Check health of all production agents"

### Team Lead

**AI:** Currently executes one step at a time, but you can chain commands in conversation.

### Context Awareness

The AI remembers the last 10 messages in your conversation, allowing for follow-up questions:

**You:** "Show me agents"
**AI:** *lists agents*
**You:** "What about their deployment history?"
**AI:** *shows history for previously mentioned agents*

### Smart Defaults

If you don't specify:
- Branch ‚Üí defaults to `main`
- Status ‚Üí shows all
- Time window ‚Üí last 24 hours
